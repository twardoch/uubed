### Fixed Issues

- **NumPy Compatibility**: Resolved by adding numpy>=1.20 to project dependencies. Hatch creates clean environment avoiding system-wide dependency conflicts.
- **Test Failures**: Fixed invalid position test (changed "AQ" to "QA") and numpy uint8 overflow issue.
- **Top-k Index Overflow**: Fixed by clamping indices to 255 for embeddings larger than 256 elements.
- **Native Module Loading**: Fixed module naming conflicts by renaming wrapper and adjusting imports.
- **Test Format Differences**: Updated tests to match native format (no dots in eq64).
- **Build System**: Successfully integrated maturin with Python packaging.
- **Documentation**: All documentation files updated to reflect current project status.
