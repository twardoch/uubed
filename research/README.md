## Organization

Research materials are versioned alongside the main codebase to preserve the development history and decision-making process. These files provide context for future contributors and document the evolution of the project's core ideas.

## Usage

These materials are for reference only. Production code should be based on the finalized implementations in the respective language repositories (uubed-rs, uubed-py).
