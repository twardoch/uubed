# PROJECT: Specification for `uubed` High-Performance Encoding Library

## 1. üéØ Project Mandate & Methodology

**Objective:** This document outlines the development roadmap for a production-grade, high-performance library for locality-preserving semantic embedding encoding. The conceptual foundation for this work is based on the research and development contained in `llms.txt` and the prototype implementations in `work/voyemb.py`.

**Current Status:** Phase 3 (Integration & Packaging) nearly complete. Native Rust implementation delivers 40-105x performance improvement!

**Virtual Team:**

- **Project Architect:** Leads the specification and implementation process.
- **Ideot:** Provides creative, unorthodox solutions and challenges conventional thinking.
- **Critin:** Critiques flawed logic, stress-tests ideas, and ensures a balanced, robust final design.

**Working Principles:** The team adheres to the core principles of iterative development. Focus on minimal viable increments, write exceptionally clear documentation explaining the "what" and the "why," and modularize logic into clean, single-purpose functions. All work should be a collaborative, step-by-step process of sharing thoughts and adapting.

**Tools & Research:** Before and during the implementation process, leverage the following tools when available:

- Consult the `context7` tool for the most up-to-date software package documentation.
- Use `deepseek/deepseek-r1-0528` and `openai/o3` via `chat_completion` for additional reasoning and problem-solving assistance.
- Employ `sequentialthinking` to structure complex decision-making processes.
- Gather current information and context using `perplexity_ask` and `duckduckgo_web_search`.

2. Are we over-engineering any component? ‚úÖ No - focused on core functionality
3. What would a new user find confusing? ‚ö†Ô∏è Maybe the different encoding methods
