# PROJECT: Specification for `uubed` High-Performance Encoding Library

## 1. ðŸŽ¯ Project Mandate & Methodology

**Objective:** This document outlines the development roadmap for a production-grade, high-performance library for locality-preserving semantic embedding encoding. The conceptual foundation for this work is based on the research and development contained in `llms.txt` and the prototype implementations in `work/voyemb.py`.

**Current Status:** Initial prototyping complete with QuadB64 family of encodings demonstrating locality preservation.

**Virtual Team:**

- **Project Architect:** Leads the specification and implementation process.
- **Ideot:** Provides creative, unorthodox solutions and challenges conventional thinking.
- **Critin:** Critiques flawed logic, stress-tests ideas, and ensures a balanced, robust final design.

**Working Principles:** The team adheres to the core principles of iterative development. Focus on minimal viable increments, write exceptionally clear documentation explaining the "what" and the "why," and modularize logic into clean, single-purpose functions. All work should be a collaborative, step-by-step process of sharing thoughts and adapting.

**Tools & Research:** Before and during the implementation process, leverage the following tools when available:

- Consult the `context7` tool for the most up-to-date software package documentation.
- Use `deepseek/deepseek-r1-0528` and `openai/o3` via `chat_completion` for additional reasoning and problem-solving assistance.
- Employ `sequentialthinking` to structure complex decision-making processes.
- Gather current information and context using `perplexity_ask` and `duckduckgo_web_search`.

## 2. Part A: Core Implementation (Python â†’ Rust/C)

_The prototype in `voyemb.py` demonstrates the concepts. Now we need to build the production-grade native library._

### 2.1. Foundational Architectural Decisions

- [x] **Proof of Concept:** Python implementation of QuadB64 family complete
- [ ] **Language Choice:** Finalize decision between Rust vs. C for core library

  - **Task:** Create benchmarks comparing PyO3 vs CFFI performance with the QuadB64 encodings
  - **Ideot's Input:** Consider Zig for its simplicity and C ABI compatibility, or Rust with careful attention to compile-time optimizations
  - **Critin's Check:** Ensure build complexity doesn't impact adoption. Users should install via `[uv] pip install uubed` without needing Rust toolchain

- [ ] **Library Structure & API:** Design the native library interface
  - [ ] Define C-style API with clear ownership semantics
  - [ ] Create error handling strategy (error codes â†’ Python exceptions)
  - [ ] Design streaming API for large embedding batches
  - [ ] Implement zero-copy interfaces where possible

### 2.2. Implementation Plan for Encoding Schemes

**Status:** Python prototypes complete, need native implementations.

- [ ] **Core Encodings Checklist:**
  - [x] **QuadB64 Codec:** Python implementation complete as `q64_encode/decode`
  - [ ] **QuadB64 Native:** Port to Rust/C with SIMD optimizations
  - [x] **SimHash-q64:** Python implementation complete
  - [ ] **SimHash-q64 Native:** Optimize random projection with BLAS
  - [x] **Top-k-q64:** Python implementation complete

  - [x] **Z-order-q64:** Python implementation complete
  - [ ] **Z-order-q64 Native:** Optimize Morton encoding with bit manipulation
  - [ ] **Base64 with MSB trick:** Port the 33-byte optimization

### 2.3. Performance & Validation

- [ ] **Benchmarking Suite:**

  - [ ] Throughput tests: embeddings/second for each encoding
  - [ ] Memory usage profiling
  - [ ] Comparison with numpy/pure Python baseline
  - [ ] SIMD vs scalar performance comparison

- [ ] **Testing Strategy:**
  - [x] Python prototype tests (implicit in voyemb.py demonstrations)

  - [ ] Property-based tests with Hypothesis
  - [ ] Cross-language validation (Python â†” Native identical outputs)
  - [ ] Fuzzing for edge cases

  - [ ] Create proof-of-concept for both approaches

- [ ] **Pythonic API Design:**

  ```python
  # Target API
  from uubed import encode, decode

  # Automatic encoding selection
  encoded = encode(embedding, method="auto")  # Returns best encoding

  # Specific encodings
  q64_str = encode(embedding, method="q64")
  shq64_str = encode(embedding, method="simhash-q64")

  # Batch operations
  encoded_batch = encode(embeddings_list, method="q64", parallel=True)
  ```

### 3.3. Distribution

- [x] **CI/CD Pipeline:** GitHub Actions configured
- [ ] **Binary Wheels:**
  - [ ] Configure cibuildwheel for multi-platform builds

## 10. "Wait, but" Reflection Points

After each implementation phase, the team should ask:

1. Is the API as simple as it could be?
2. Are we over-engineering any component?
3. What would a new user find confusing?
4. Can we reduce the cognitive load further?
5. Are all features truly necessary for v1.0?
