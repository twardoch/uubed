### Remaining Tasks
- [ ] Add memory usage profiling to benchmarks
- [ ] Upload to TestPyPI for validation


## Phase 4: Publishing & Distribution ðŸ”„ IN PROGRESS

### Pre-Release Preparation
- [ ] Update version numbers in all files (Python, Rust, pyproject.toml)
- [ ] Create comprehensive README.md
- [ ] Add badges for CI status, PyPI version, etc.
- [ ] Update CHANGELOG.md with release notes
- [ ] Run full test suite on all platforms
- [ ] Execute final performance benchmarks
- [ ] Review and update all documentation

### Binary Wheel Building
- [x] Maturin-action configured in GitHub Actions
- [x] Multi-platform wheel building working
- [ ] Build source distribution: `maturin sdist`
- [ ] Verify wheel contents and sizes
- [ ] Test wheel installation in clean environments

### Package Testing
- [ ] Create fresh virtual environment for testing
- [ ] Install wheel without dev dependencies
- [ ] Test all encoding methods work correctly
- [ ] Verify native acceleration is active
- [ ] Check fallback works when native unavailable
- [ ] Test on different Python versions

### PyPI Upload
- [ ] Install twine: `pip install twine`
- [ ] Upload to TestPyPI first for validation
- [ ] Test installation from TestPyPI
- [ ] Fix any issues found during testing
- [ ] Upload to production PyPI: `twine upload dist/*`
- [ ] Verify package page on PyPI looks correct
- [ ] Test installation with `pip install uubed`

## Immediate Next Steps

### Performance Optimization
- [ ] Optimize Top-k encoder in Rust (currently slower than Python for some sizes)
- [ ] Enable actual SIMD optimizations in Q64 encoder
- [ ] Profile SimHash matrix operations for improvement

### Final Steps Before Release
- [ ] Build and test source distribution
- [ ] Validate package on TestPyPI
- [ ] Create release announcement

## Future Work

### Advanced Features
- [ ] Implement streaming API for large datasets
- [ ] Add GPU acceleration exploration
- [ ] Create plugins for vector databases
- [ ] Add Matryoshka embedding support
- [ ] Implement binary quantization options

### Ecosystem Integration
- [ ] Create LangChain integration
- [ ] Add Pinecone vector DB plugin
- [ ] Implement Weaviate connector
- [ ] Create example notebooks
- [ ] Build demo applications

### Quality Assurance
- [x] All tests passing (9/9)
- [ ] Add property-based tests with Hypothesis
- [ ] Add fuzzing tests for edge cases
- [x] Cross-platform testing via GitHub Actions
- [ ] Create performance regression tests
- [ ] Add integration tests with real embeddings

## Success Metrics Achieved

### Remaining Success Metrics
- [ ] Process 1M embeddings/second on modern hardware
- [ ] Maintain memory efficiency (< 2x input size)
- [ ] Support batch sizes up to 100k embeddings
- [ ] Zero critical bugs in production
- [ ] Keep installation size under 10MB
