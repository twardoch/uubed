# TODO

## Completed Tasks âœ…
- [x] Core implementation and analysis completed
- [x] Repository structure and coordination established
- [x] Advanced research on Matryoshka embeddings completed

## Outstanding Tasks

### Cross-Repository Coordination (Medium Priority)
- [ ] Provide GitHub Actions that trigger downstream builds
- [ ] Establish release tagging policy
- [ ] Create comprehensive API reference using Sphinx
- [ ] Add more code examples in docstrings
- [ ] Create troubleshooting guide for common errors

### Performance and Testing (High Priority)
- [ ] Profile the code to identify bottlenecks
- [ ] Consider implementing parallel processing for batch operations
- [ ] Add caching for frequently encoded embeddings
- [ ] Add unit tests for all identified edge cases
- [ ] Create integration tests for streaming operations
- [ ] Add performance benchmarks for different encoding methods
